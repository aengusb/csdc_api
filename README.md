Join me for a hands-on workshop in getting started with public data-serving Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs allow programmatic access to large data streams and are increasingly being used across social science disciplines to store, curate, and provide access to large datasets. We will focus on using APIs for Reddit and Open Parliament, and the workshop will include a demonstration of how to use the Twitter API directly. The workshop will be taught using R with a focus on the httr and jsonlite packages. Topics covered will also include responsible API use, rate limits, and working with .json data. After the workshop, students will have the tools they need to begin to access numerous public datasets available through APIs. The workshop will conclude with a brief demonstration of SQL using the RSQLite package for better managing large volumes of data collected from APIs.
